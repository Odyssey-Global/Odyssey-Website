          <p>2020 was a landmark year that led to paradigm shifts in the world of work across the globe.
            The Covid-19 pandemic created a sea of changes in the way people look at work and life in general.
            Further, the complexities and dynamism of markets are increasing. As a result, the nature of work
            and the workplace is changing at a rapid pace to accommodate shifting employee exceptions and
            market demands. And Canada is no exception to the rule.
            From rapid technological advancements and widening skill gaps to increasing demand for
            flexibility and the rising popularity of contract work and remote work, certain key trends are
            influencing the future of work in Canada. Businesses need to adapt to these trends and make changes
            in their staffing strategies. In doing so, they can drive competitive advantages and thrive in the
            ever-evolving, dynamic business landscape.
            In this blog, we will take a closer look at 5 key trends shaping the future of work in Canada. </p>

          <h5>Technological Advancements & the Widening Skill Gap
          </h5>

          <p>Technology is advancing at an accelerated pace and is disrupting the world of work in more ways than one.
            Advanced technology such as intelligent automation, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML),
            robotics,
            and big data, among others is now being used widely across industries. Such technologies are creating a
            paradigm shift
            in how work is done.
          </p>

          <p>While technology will cause job loss, it will also add new jobs and change the nature of jobs that remain.
            This trend is already
            underway and is disrupting the labor market. New jobs and careers are already emerging across sectors, and
            specialized skills
            are in high demand. </p>

          <p>Secondly, there is an increasing adoption of automation and AI by businesses to remove repetitive,
            low-value, manual jobs,
            freeing up employee bandwidth. Employees can use the time saved on innovation, strategy and other high-value
            activities
            that need their skills and expertise. </p>
          <p>Thirdly, technological advancements are also transforming the skills required by organizations. The demand
            for skills
            isn’t adequately met by a supply of skilled professionals, leading to a widening skill gap.
            In the face of the skill gap, organizations are investing in learning and development initiatives to upskill
            and reskill
            employees to keep pace with rapidly evolving technology. It is also in the best interest of individuals in
            the job market to
            upskill and reskill themselves to improve their chances of getting hired. </p>

          <h5>The Increasing Focus on Flexibility
          </h5>

          <p>Ever since 2020, there has been an increasing demand for flexibility among employees.
            Job flexibility, whether in terms of flexi shifts or flexi workweek, helps employees maintain a
            healthy work-life balance. It has several physical, mental and emotional benefits. It helps in reducing
            stress and improving the overall well-being of employees.</p>

          <p>While employers are increasingly offering job flexibility to white-collar/ office workers, blue- and
            grey-collar
            workers don’t enjoy the same benefits. But it is as important a consideration to non-office workers as
            office workers.</p>

          <p>In fact, 46% of non-office workers believe that flexibility is as important or more important than their
            compensation.
            39% of these workers end up using medical leave to manage personal responsibilities. 30% even left their job
            due to lack
            of flexibility. </p>
          <p>There is a need for a shift in management philosophy towards a result-focused measurement of performance
            rather than
            the physical presence of employees. It requires more employers to understand that employees can
            be successful while working in flexible environments. </p>
          <p>For improved equity in the workplace and retention of top talent in the office and non-office workforce,
            employers
            must redefine work for non-office workers, expanding the scope to include tasks that can be performed
            offsite.
            They must offer enhanced support to non-office workers to help them meet their personal obligations
            including care work.
            Employers should also establish holistic wellness plans to help non-office workers reduce their stress
            levels and build a healthier,
            more productive workforce. </p>

          <p>Job flexibility is a significant factor for a growing number of candidates, especially among millennials
            and Gen Z.
            So, employers need to redesign strategies to offer greater flexibility to employees to stay competitive
            in the job market and retain top-quality talent. </p>

          <h5>The Mainstreaming of Remote and Hybrid Work </h5>

          <p>Remote and hybrid work used to be a good-to-have in the pre-pandemic era with only a handful of companies
            offering these options.
            The pandemic showed both employees and employers that work can happen anywhere, thanks to the rapidly
            advancing technology.
            Today, remote and hybrid work models have become mainstream with more companies establishing formal
            work-from-home policies
            and offering remote/hybrid work options. </p>

          <p>Offering hybrid and remote work options boosts the morale of employees and keeps the workforce happier,
            healthier and more productive. It enables employers to stay competitive in the job market and improve
            their chances of attracting and retaining the best talent.</p>

          <p>While remote/hybrid work improves job flexibility and boosts employee satisfaction levels, employers
            need to ensure that employees still have a sense of belonging. Employees’ need for mentoring,
            networking and personal connections should be fulfilled while offering the choice to work from wherever they
            are. </p>

          <h5>The Rising Popularity of Contract Work
          </h5>

          <p>The rise of the gig economy, a tight labor market, a widening skill gap and the demand for flexibility have
            led to the rising popularity of contract work. Contract work has powerful benefits for employees and
            employers. </p>

          <p>For employees, there is greater flexibility when they can choose employers and roles. They can work with
            more than one employer at a time or shift more smoothly between employers. They can strengthen and develop a
            specialized skillset. They can build strong networks and relationships across the industry. </p>

          <p>For employers, contract work helps them reduce labor shortages and fill in positions in an accelerated
            manner. They can quickly fill skill gaps and have the flexibility to offer long- and short-term contracts to
            professionals. For SMEs and startups, they can access highly specialized skills without making a permanent
            hire, saving significantly on their compensation bills. </p>
          <p>By employing the services of strategic contract staffing agencies like Odyssey Global, employers gain
            access to a global pool of highly qualified professionals. Odyssey Global not only matches great talent with
            the employer but takes care of onboarding and training. With staffing partners like Odyssey, employers can
            infuse greater agility, scalability and efficiency into the hiring process, hitting the ground running on
            critical projects. </p>

          <h5>Demographic Shifts and Growing Labor Shortages </h5>

          <p>Canada is undergoing demographic shifts leading to an aging population, increasing average age of the
            workforce, and increasing retirements. This is creating a massive labor shortage in the country and the loss
            of skills. Data suggests that Canada will have 4.4 million job vacancies in the future owing to demographic
            shifts and the aging workforce. </p>

          <p>To navigate the growing labor shortage and skill deficit, employers need to redesign their staffing
            strategies. They must encourage more labor force participation from among underrepresented groups including
            indigenous groups, older workers, women from marginalized backgrounds and so on while strengthening their
            diversity, inclusion and equity (DEI) policies. They must access workers from beyond their local labor
            markets and find talent from diverse, global talent pools. </p>

          <p>With premier staffing agencies like Odyssey Global, employers can effortlessly access such diverse talent
            pools and fill in vacancies at an accelerated pace. </p>
          <p>These are the 5 key trends that will shape the future of work in Canada. Organizations need to relook and
            redesign their staffing and HR strategies to adapt to these trends to more effectively navigate the
            ever-evolving business landscape and drive competitive advantage. </p>

          <h5>How to go from perfect first touchpoint to perfect follow-up dialogue</h5>

          <p>We get that what you’re offering may not immediately set people’s world alight. You may not have the most
            ridiculous starting salary that knocks all of the other salary offerings out of the park. But you may be
            able to offer a better work-life balance, greater flexibility, a nurturing culture and perks, such as a free
            gym membership and duvet days.</p>

          <p>These are the things that are going to help compel candidates to gravitate towards you. But they aren’t
            going to know about these positives unless they’re reflected on the likes of Glassdoor, in your Employee
            Value Proposition, and in your outreach messaging. So that when you do win their attention, it’s not
            immediately lost.</p>

          <p>Good luck, you’ve totally got this.</p>
