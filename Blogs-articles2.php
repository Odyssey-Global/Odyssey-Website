          <h5>Why is a Resume So Important?</h5>

          <p>Recruiters and hiring managers are often flooded with hundreds and thousands of resumes. This means that
            they will not be able to spend equal or enough time on each resume. They often spend a few seconds to
            minutes skimming through each resume. Candidates have just those many seconds or minutes to capture and
            retain the attention of the recruiter/ hiring manager.
          </p>

          <p>Amid the noise and clutter, your resume must provide them with all the necessary details. It should give
            them a snapshot of your skills, accomplishments, experience and other relevant information. It needs to be
            unique, engaging and compelling, which is why generic resumes never work! </p>

          <p>If you do not want your resume to be tossed into the reject pile, you must learn the art and science of
            making an effective resume. Your resume should be effective in winning the recruiter’s attention and
            boosting your chances of getting interview calls.

          <h6>Resume Writing Mistakes to Avoid </h6>

          The following mistakes often reduce the candidate’s chances of getting interview calls. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your resume is generic or follows the biodata pattern. </li>
            <li>Your resume is too wordy. </li>
            <li>You have not chronologically listed your work experience and the work experience section does not appear
              in the first half of the resume. </li>
            <li>Your work experience highlights your job responsibilities rather than your impact and accomplishments.
            </li>
            <li>There are grammatical and spelling errors in the resume or formatting flaws. </li>
            <li>The references provided in the resume aren’t strong enough. </li>
            <li>The cover letter is generic or too short. </li>

          <h5> Keep Your Resume Short and Direct </h5>
          <p>The most important rule to writing an effective resume is keeping it short, to the point and direct. The
            general rule is to keep it no longer than 2 pages, unless you have good reason to make it any longer. Even
            if you are a highly experienced professional with a long career, it is best to highlight your work
            experience for the previous 10-15 years.

          <h5> Tell Your Story Concisely </h5>
          <p>You must coherently narrate your story within the 2 pages of the resume. The storytelling in the resume
            must be precise, compelling and interesting. Text-heavy, wordy resumes will make the recruiter lose interest
            in getting to its end. So, it is best to write your resume in a way that it answers every question that a
            recruiter may have about your professional journey, story and skills.

          <h5> Showcase Your Experience and Skills </h5>
          <p>You should show rather than tell the recruiter about your skills, accomplishments, etc. For instance, you
            could quantify your experience, skills, and accomplishments, wherever possible, using quantifiable metrics.
          </p>
          <p>You should use action verbs such as completed, managed, led, developed, created, sold, designed, achieved,
            etc. along with superlatives such as highest, fastest and best, among others. It is important to be
            assertive but not pompous.
          </p>
          <p>You can use infographics or other pictorial representations to showcase your skillset.

        <h5> Customize Your Resume to Each Job </h5>
        <p>Your resume is your marketing document, and it works best when it is tailored to target the job that you are
          applying to. So, ensure that you take your time to research the company and role thoroughly before applying
          for the job. Using these insights, you should tailor your resume to highlight all relevant aspects of your
          experience, skillset, accomplishments, etc. </p>
        <p>You should tell the recruiter how your vision and values align with the company’s values and culture. Find
          10-15 keywords from the job description to use in the resume. You could embolden them to highlight it to the
          recruiter. </p>

        <h5> Write a Strong and Compelling Summary </h5>
        <p>

          Your resume must include a succinct, strong executive summary right at the top. Keep it clear, concise and
          persuasive using no more
          than 30-40 words. It should clearly convey your USP and suitability to the recruiter. Think of the
          professional summary as a
          branding statement rather than an objective statement. </p>

        <h5> Presentation and Readability Are Critical </h5>
        <p>A cluttered, verbose resume isn’t going to resonate with the recruiter. For your resume to stand out amid the
          pile of resumes, you need to make sure it is clean and readable. Choose a unique template with proper spacing
          and alignment, readable fonts and a simple yet effective design. The content in the resume should flow
          seamlessly and have clear sections. The navigation should be easy and the details easily readable. It is best
          to use headers, sub-headers, bullet points, diagrams/ pictorial representations, and so on. </p>

        <h5> Proofread Carefully </h5>
        <p>Errors in your resume can detract from professionalism, which is why you must thoroughly proofread and edit
          the document several times. Get feedback from your peers and mentors and incorporate it into your resume. </p>
        <p>In a highly competitive job market, a compelling resume is your ticket to secure interviews with companies
          you want to work with and advance your career. We hope this guide helps you craft a powerful resume that
          resonates with recruiters and improves your chances of getting those interview calls. </p>

          <h5>How to go from perfect first touchpoint to perfect follow-up dialogue</h5>

          <p>We get that what you’re offering may not immediately set people’s world alight. You may not have the most
            ridiculous starting salary that knocks all of the other salary offerings out of the park. But you may be
            able to offer a better work-life balance, greater flexibility, a nurturing culture and perks, such as a free
            gym membership and duvet days.</p>

          <p>These are the things that are going to help compel candidates to gravitate towards you. But they aren’t
            going to know about these positives unless they’re reflected on the likes of Glassdoor, in your Employee
            Value Proposition, and in your outreach messaging. So that when you do win their attention, it’s not
            immediately lost.</p>

          <p>Good luck, you’ve totally got this.</p>
